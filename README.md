Based on this analysis, the results can be interpreted as follows- Student spending range on the higher end of the spectrum (630-645) achieved the highest scores in both Mathematics and Reading. However, schools with a size of less than 1000 students, had an overallpassing rate of 89.88% . One can infer, that this might be due to specialized attention due to smaller class sizes. Charter schools also can be seen to outperform district school's passing rate with a comparison of 90.43% to 53.47%.
Parents/legal guardians could increase per student spend for overall performance improvement. Smaller charter schools also can be associated with overall better performance due to the reasons listed above.
